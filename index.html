      We are Botik, a specialized translation and localization service dedicated to contributing to the body of literature that both Persian and English speakers can appreciate and enjoy. We see our main task as making an unfamiliar world for these two groups into a familiar one. Literature, poetry, TV programs, memoirs, and many other kinds of media in foreign languages serve as a gateway to understanding the values, desires, history, fears, and dreams of a foreign people, and we like to think of the main benefit of our work as helping foster further understanding and empathy among nations.

      <p class="main-text-color main-paragraphs">
        In addition to a strong commitment to this vision, what sets Botik apart is our complementary language expertise, our attention to detail, and our dedication to translating the cultural and emotional weight of a text and not just the literal meaning. We expand the imaginations of readers of a translated work and give them new vocabulary. We give them new concepts that don't even exist in their native language.
